# The Digital Workshop

A single desktop workspace for CNC woodworkers — combining a 3D model library, G-code toolpath analysis, and 2D cut optimization in one application. No cloud, no subscriptions, no switching between tools.

Built with C++17, OpenGL 3.3, and Dear ImGui. Runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Why

A typical CNC woodworking workflow touches half a dozen disconnected tools: a slicer for CAM, a separate G-code viewer to sanity-check toolpaths, a spreadsheet to track material costs, a folder full of STL files with cryptic names, and maybe a cut-list optimizer that only runs on Windows. None of them talk to each other. You end up context-switching between apps, re-entering dimensions, and mentally stitching together information that should live in one place.

Digital Workshop exists to collapse that into a single workspace. Import your models, preview the toolpaths your CAM software generated, figure out how to cut the parts from the stock you have on hand, and keep it all organized by project — without leaving the app. It's built for the hobbyist or small-shop woodworker who wants one place to think about a project from model to material to machine.

It's also fully offline and open source. Your files stay on your machine, the database is a single SQLite file, and every dependency uses a permissive license. There's no account to create, no telemetry, and no feature that stops working if a server goes down.

## Features

### 3D Model Library
- Import STL, OBJ, and 3MF files with drag-and-drop (including recursive folders)
- Content-addressable storage with SHA-based deduplication
- Automatic thumbnail generation via offscreen OpenGL rendering
- Full-text search across names, tags, filenames, and categories
- Two-level category hierarchy, batch operations, and multi-select
- Graph-based relationship queries between models, materials, and projects

### G-code Analysis
- Parses G0/G1/G2/G3 (linear, rapid, arc), coordinate modes, tool changes, and spindle commands
- Computes total path length, cutting vs. rapid distance, estimated machining time, and bounding box
- Trapezoidal motion planning with per-axis velocity and acceleration limits
- Machine profiles for popular CNCs (Shapeoko 4, LongMill MK2) with GRBL `$`-parameter mapping
- 2D and 3D color-coded toolpath visualization (cutting moves vs. rapids)

### 3D Viewport
- OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile renderer with orbit camera and ViewCube navigation
- Adjustable directional lighting, wireframe mode, grid, and axis indicator
- Material texture mapping with planar UV projection
- Color-coded 3D toolpath rendering as extruded quads

### Materials System
- 32 built-in material archives covering hardwoods, softwoods, composites, metals, and plastics
- Two-source loading: user materials override bundled defaults, bundled materials load directly from the install directory
- Material properties: Janka hardness, feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cut, cost per board-foot, grain direction
- Bundled materials can be hidden but not deleted; user materials are fully removable
- `.dwmat` archive format for sharing materials between users
- Optional AI-assisted material generation via Google Gemini API

### 2D Cut Optimization
- First-Fit Decreasing and Guillotine packing algorithms
- Per-part rotation and grain direction constraints
- Cost breakdown estimation with efficiency metrics
- Cut plans saved to database and linked to projects

### Project Management
- Associate models, G-code, materials, cut plans, cost estimates, and notes into projects
- Collapsible asset navigator with cross-panel navigation
- Export projects as portable `.dwproj` ZIP archives with all assets included
- Full round-trip: export on one machine, import on another with deduplication

### CNC Tool Database
- Vectric-compatible `.vtdb` format — tools can be shared with Aspire/VCarve
- Hierarchical tool tree with groups and drag-and-drop organization
- Tool geometries: end mill, ball nose, V-bit, drill, radiused, tapered, and more
- Per-material, per-machine cutting data (feed rate, plunge rate, spindle speed, stepdown, stepover)
- Import tools from existing `.vtdb` files

### Feeds & Speeds Calculator
- Beginner-safe conservative calculations based on Janka hardness, tool geometry, and machine specs
- 7 material classifications: soft/medium/hard/very-hard wood, composite, metal, plastic
- Machine rigidity derating by drive type: belt (80%), lead screw (90%), ball screw/rack & pinion (100%)
- Automatic power limiting — reduces depth of cut when spindle wattage is exceeded
- One-click "Apply to Cutting Data" writes calculated values directly to the tool database

### GRBL CNC Controller
- Serial port communication with RX buffer accounting (128-byte buffer)
- Feed, rapid, and spindle override commands
- Real-time machine status polling (position, feed rate, spindle speed, overrides)
- Machine profile dialog for per-axis configuration

### Settings
- Companion `dw_settings` application with hot-reload (no restart needed)
- Customizable input bindings, machine profiles, and theme selection
- Dark, light, and high-contrast themes

## Installing

Pre-built installers are attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/NoobyNull/The-Digital-Workshop/releases). Download the one for your platform:

| Platform | Format | How to install |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Linux | `.run` | `chmod +x DigitalWorkshop-*.run && ./DigitalWorkshop-*.run` |
| Windows | `.msi` | Double-click the installer |
| Windows | `.zip` | Extract and run `digital_workshop.exe` |
| macOS | `.dmg` | Open the disk image and drag to Applications |

### Linux install details

The `.run` installer is a self-extracting archive (makeself). It supports two modes:

```bash
# User install (default) — installs to ~/.local/bin
./DigitalWorkshop-v1.5.0-linux.run

# System install — installs to /usr/local/bin
sudo ./DigitalWorkshop-v1.5.0-linux.run -- --system
```

Both modes install `digital_workshop` and `dw_settings` binaries and create a `.desktop` entry so the app appears in your application launcher. To uninstall, run the `uninstall.sh` script from the extracted directory (or `--system` for system-wide).

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libgl-dev zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

**Windows:** Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ workload. Dependencies are fetched automatically via CMake FetchContent.

**macOS:** Xcode command-line tools. SDL2 can be installed via Homebrew (`brew install sdl2`) or will be fetched automatically.

### Build

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDW_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Install from build

```bash
# User install (to ~/.local/bin)
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local

# System install (to /usr/local)
sudo cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local
```

Or use the packaging scripts to create a distributable installer:

| Platform | Command | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Linux | `./packaging/linux/make-installer.sh build <version>` | Self-extracting `.run` installer |
| Windows | `cd build && cpack -G WIX -C Release` | `.msi` installer |
| Windows | `cd build && cpack -G ZIP -C Release` | `.zip` portable |
| macOS | `cd build && cpack -G DragNDrop -C Release` | `.dmg` disk image |

### Run

```bash
./build/digital_workshop
```

### Test

```bash
./build/tests/dw_tests
```

655 tests covering loaders, parsers, database repositories, the optimizer, tool calculator, import/export pipelines, and more.

### CMake Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|

```

The core layer has zero dependencies on UI or rendering code. The `Application` class is a thin coordinator that wires managers and panels together. Worker threads communicate with the UI via `MainThreadQueue`. SQLite runs in WAL mode with a connection pool for thread-safe access.
