# Project Templates

Start a new project from a predefined template structure (e.g., "CNC Woodworking" template includes standard sheet sizes, default materials, cost categories).

- Template stored as a .dwproj archive in a templates/ directory
- "New from Template" option in project creation
- Templates can be user-created (export current project as template)
