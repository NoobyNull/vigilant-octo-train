# Phase 01.6 Plan 01: Dead Code Cleanup Summary

**One-liner:** Replaced FontAwesome unicode codepoints with readable text labels, verified DEAD-01 through DEAD-06 resolution status

## What Was Accomplished

Cleaned up the icon system and validated dead code items from Phase 1.6. Research found that DEAD-01 through DEAD-04 were already removed from the codebase, DEAD-06 was a false claim (no theme duplication exists), and DEAD-05 needed action: replacing FontAwesome unicode constants with text labels since the icon font was never loaded.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Replace FontAwesome Icon Constants with Text Labels

**What changed:**
- Removed all FontAwesome unicode codepoints (`\xEF\x85\x9B` etc.) from `src/ui/icons.h`
- Replaced with readable text labels: `[+]`, `[-]`, `[X]`, `[M]`, `[i]`, `[?]`, etc.
- Removed `icons::text` namespace (no longer needed as fallback)
- Kept `Icons` struct API identical - all 25 members still present with same names
- All 7 files that include `icons.h` compile without any changes

**Why this matters:**
FontAwesome font was never loaded, so unicode constants rendered as garbage characters or replacement boxes. Text labels provide readable UI elements without font dependency.

**Verification:**
- No `\xEF` sequences remain in icons.h (grep confirms)
- Project builds cleanly with zero errors
- All 422 tests pass
- All `Icons::` references verified valid across 7 UI files

**Commit:** `5c095c2` - refactor(01.6-01): replace FontAwesome unicode constants with text labels

### Task 2: Verify Resolved Items and Update TODOS.md

**Verification results:**
- **DEAD-01** (ViewportPanel unused fields): NOT PRESENT - already removed
- **DEAD-02** (LibraryPanel m_contextMenuModelIndex): NOT PRESENT - already removed
- **DEAD-03** (ProjectPanel::refresh()): NOT PRESENT - already removed
- **DEAD-04** (UIManager file dialog stubs): NOT PRESENT - already removed
- **DEAD-05** (Icon font constants): RESOLVED - fixed by Task 1
- **DEAD-06** (Duplicate theme code): FALSE CLAIM - ui_manager.cpp lines 155-161 delegate to Theme::applyDark()/applyLight(), no duplication exists

**What changed:**
- Updated `.planning/TODOS.md` marking all 6 DEAD items as resolved
- Added resolution notes explaining outcome for each item
- DEAD-01 through DEAD-04: "not present in current codebase (already removed)"
- DEAD-05: "Replaced FontAwesome unicode constants with text labels"
- DEAD-06: "False claim. ui_manager.cpp delegates to Theme::applyDark()/applyLight(), no duplication exists"

**Commit:** `c97fc71` - docs(01.6-01): mark all DEAD items as resolved in TODOS.md

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Technical Notes

**Icon label choices:**
- File operations: `[New]`, `[Open]`, `[Save]`, `[Import]`, `[Export]`
- View controls: `[+]`, `[-]`, `[Fit]`, `[Grid]`
- Actions: `[+]`, `[-]`, `[X]`, `[Search]`, `[Filter]`, `[Refresh]`
- Object types: `[M]` (model), `[P]` (project), `[D]` (directory), `[F]` (file)
- Status: `[i]`, `[!]`, `[X]`, `[?]`
- View modes: `[List]`

**API stability:**
The `Icons` struct provides 25 static constexpr members that existing code references. Keeping the same struct shape means zero breaking changes - all call sites like `ImGui::Button(Icons::Refresh)` continue to work, just with different underlying string values.

**Why DEAD-01 through DEAD-04 were already gone:**
Research revealed these items don't exist in current codebase. Either they were removed in previous cleanup work, or TODOS.md line numbers referred to old codebase state. Verification via `grep -r` across entire `src/` directory confirmed absence.

**Why DEAD-06 is false:**
`ui_manager.cpp` lines 155-161 show thin wrapper methods:
```cpp
void UIManager::applyDarkTheme() {
    Theme::applyDark();
}

void UIManager::applyLightTheme() {
    Theme::applyLight();
}
```
This is proper delegation, not duplication. The actual theme implementation lives only in `Theme` class.

## Impact

**Code quality:** Removed confusing unicode constants, replaced with readable text
**UI clarity:** Icons now display as readable text instead of garbage characters
**Documentation:** TODOS.md now accurately reflects codebase state
**Test coverage:** Zero regressions, all 422 tests pass

**Files affected:**
- `src/ui/icons.h` - 93 lines → 76 lines (removed unicode section, removed text namespace)
- `.planning/TODOS.md` - 6 DEAD items marked resolved

**Call sites unchanged:**
All 7 files that use `Icons::` members compiled without modification:
- `src/ui/panels/library_panel.cpp`
- `src/ui/panels/project_panel.cpp`
- `src/ui/panels/gcode_panel.cpp`
- `src/ui/panels/cut_optimizer_panel.cpp`
- `src/ui/dialogs/file_dialog.cpp`
- `src/ui/dialogs/message_dialog.cpp`
- `src/ui/icons.h` (Icons struct definition)

## Self-Check: PASSED

**Created files exist:**
```bash
[ -f ".planning/TODOS.md" ] && echo "FOUND"
# FOUND
```

**Modified files exist:**
```bash
[ -f "src/ui/icons.h" ] && echo "FOUND"
# FOUND
```

**Commits exist:**
```bash
git log --oneline --all | grep "5c095c2"
# 5c095c2 refactor(01.6-01): replace FontAwesome unicode constants with text labels

git log --oneline --all | grep "c97fc71"
# c97fc71 docs(01.6-01): mark all DEAD items as resolved in TODOS.md
```

**Key claims verified:**
- No FontAwesome unicode in icons.h: `grep -r "\xEF" src/ui/icons.h` returns no matches ✓
- All tests pass: `ctest` shows 422/422 passed ✓
- All DEAD items resolved: `grep -c "\- \[x\].*DEAD-" .planning/TODOS.md` returns 6 ✓

All claims verified. Self-check passed.
