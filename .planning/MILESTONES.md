# Milestones: Digital Workshop

## Completed Milestones

### v0.1.x: CNC Controller Suite (2026-02-24 → 2026-02-25)

**Goal:** Integrate existing subsystems (tool database, feeds/speeds calculator, material system, GRBL controller) into a usable CNC workflow.

**Phases:** 8 (all complete)
- Phase 1: Fix Foundation (thread safety, disconnect detection, DTR suppression)
- Phase 2: Status Display (DRO, machine state, feed/spindle)
- Phase 3: Manual Control (jog, homing, WCS, MDI console)
- Phase 4: Tool Integration (tool selector, material selector, feeds/speeds)
- Phase 5: Job Streaming (progress, time estimation, feed deviation)
- Phase 6: Job Safety (pause/resume/abort, sensor display, pre-flight, draw outline)
- Phase 7: Firmware Settings (GRBL $$ editor, NC/NO toggles, backup/restore)
- Phase 8: Macros (SQLite storage, built-in macros, keyboard shortcuts)

**Requirements:** 39 total, 39 complete
