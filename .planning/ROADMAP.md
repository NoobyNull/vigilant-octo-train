### v0.5.5 Unified 3D Viewport (Phases 31-35)

**Milestone Goal:** Merge G-code preview rendering into the main ViewportPanel so all 3D content (model mesh, toolpath lines) shares one camera, one renderer, and one set of controls -- eliminating duplicated rendering code and unifying user interaction.

- [x] **Phase 31: Core Toolpath Rendering** - G-code lines render in ViewportPanel with height-based depth coloring and shared camera (completed 2026-03-09)
- [x] **Phase 32: Viewport Toolbar & Toggles** - Toggle buttons and sliders for model, toolpath, move types, color-by-tool, and Z-clip (completed 2026-03-09)
- [ ] **Phase 33: Model-Toolpath Alignment** - FitParams transform overlays model and G-code correctly with point-match validation
- [ ] **Phase 34: Simulation Playback** - Play/pause/scrub simulation with completed/current/cutter visualization in viewport
- [ ] **Phase 35: GCodePanel Rendering Elimination** - Strip rendering infrastructure from GCodePanel, unify mouse interaction across layers

## Phase Details (v0.5.0)

### Phase 27: Bug Fixes & Safety
**Goal**: Known correctness bugs are fixed -- ImportQueue manages GCodeMetadata with a smart pointer and file::move() handles cross-filesystem moves without data loss
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (v0.4.0 complete)
**Requirements**: BUG-01, BUG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ImportQueue creates GCodeMetadata via std::unique_ptr or std::make_unique -- no raw new or delete calls exist in the import pipeline
  2. Moving a file between different filesystems (e.g., /tmp to /data) succeeds by falling back to copy+delete, with the original removed only after a verified copy
  3. All 931+ tests continue to pass after both fixes
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 27-01: Replace raw new/delete for GCodeMetadata with smart pointer in ImportQueue
- [ ] 27-02: Add cross-filesystem copy+delete fallback to file::move()

### Phase 28: Monolithic Function Splits
**Goal**: The five largest functions in the codebase are each decomposed into focused, named sub-functions -- no single function exceeds a readable length and all split-out files stay under 800 lines
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Requirements**: SPLIT-01, SPLIT-02, SPLIT-03, SPLIT-04, SPLIT-05, SIZE-01, QUAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Application::initWiring() delegates to domain-specific wiring functions (e.g., wireImport, wireMaterials, wireCosting) -- the top-level function is a sequenced call list, not a 900-line body
  2. ImportQueue::processTask() is decomposed into named pipeline stage functions -- each stage is independently readable and the dispatch loop is short
  3. Schema::createTables() calls per-table builder functions -- adding a new table means adding one function, not appending to a monolith
  4. Config::load() and Config::save() each delegate to per-section parser/writer functions with symmetrical structure
  5. Application::init() is decomposed into initialization phase functions and application_wiring.cpp is under 800 lines
  6. All 931+ tests continue to pass after all splits
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: Decompose Application::initWiring() into domain wiring functions
- [ ] 28-02: Decompose ImportQueue::processTask() into pipeline stage functions
- [ ] 28-03: Decompose Schema::createTables() into per-table builder functions
- [ ] 28-04: Decompose Config::load() and Config::save() into per-section functions
- [ ] 28-05: Decompose Application::init() and verify application_wiring.cpp line count

### Phase 29: Duplicate Code Consolidation
**Goal**: Repeated UI patterns that appear across multiple files are extracted into single authoritative locations -- color constants, table layout helpers, and edit buffer utilities each live in one place
**Depends on**: Phase 28
**Requirements**: DUP-01, DUP-02, DUP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A single header defines the canonical error-red, success-green, and warning-yellow ImVec4 constants -- no panel file defines its own copies of these colors
  2. A reusable helper function renders the ImGui 2-column label/value table pattern -- call sites pass label and value, not repeated BeginTable/TableSetColumnIndex boilerplate
  3. Inline edit buffer management (memset+snprintf pairs) is replaced by a utility function or wrapper at all call sites -- no panel contains raw memset+snprintf for buffer prep
  4. All 931+ tests continue to pass after consolidation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 29-01: Centralize UI color constants (error, success, warning) in a shared header
- [ ] 29-02: Extract ImGui 2-column label/value table into a reusable helper
- [ ] 29-03: Consolidate inline edit buffer management into a utility function

### Phase 30: Code Quality Polish
**Goal**: All hardcoded numeric values in visual and GUI code are replaced with values derived from the style system or config -- the codebase satisfies the no-hardcoded-values policy throughout
**Depends on**: Phase 29
**Requirements**: QUAL-01, QUAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Panel code contains no hardcoded UI scale factors -- spacing, padding, and size multipliers reference ImGui style members or config values, not raw numeric literals
  2. glClearColor is called with values from the active theme or config, not hardcoded float constants -- changing the theme background updates the clear color
  3. All 931+ tests continue to pass after the replacements
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 30-01: Replace hardcoded UI scale factors in panel code with style-derived values
- [ ] 30-02: Replace hardcoded glClearColor constants with theme/config values

## Phase Details (v0.5.5)

### Phase 31: Core Toolpath Rendering
**Goal**: G-code toolpath lines render directly in ViewportPanel using the existing shared camera, with height-based depth coloring, so the user sees both the 3D model and toolpath in one viewport
**Depends on**: Phase 30 (v0.5.0 complete)
**Requirements**: VPR-01, VPR-07, ALN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees 3D model mesh and G-code toolpath lines together in the main viewport -- one camera controls orbit, pan, and zoom for both
  2. G-code cutting paths display a height-based color gradient showing carving depth (the height-line shader from GCodePanel works in ViewportPanel)
  3. Opening an external .nc file without a loaded model renders the toolpath in the viewport on its own -- no model is required
  4. Toolpath line geometry uploads to GPU via the existing m_gpuToolpath infrastructure in ViewportPanel
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 31-01-PLAN.md — Height-line shader and G-code line rendering pipeline
- [x] 31-02-PLAN.md — GCode-to-Viewport callback wiring

### Phase 32: Viewport Toolbar & Toggles
**Goal**: User has fine-grained control over what is visible in the unified viewport through toolbar buttons and sliders
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Requirements**: VPR-02, VPR-03, VPR-04, VPR-05, VPR-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can toggle model mesh visibility on/off via a toolbar button -- the mesh disappears/reappears without affecting toolpath display
  2. User can toggle toolpath visibility on/off via a toolbar button -- the toolpath disappears/reappears without affecting model display
  3. User can independently toggle rapids, cuts, plunges, and retracts on/off -- each move type appears or disappears without affecting other types
  4. User can toggle color-by-tool mode that colors toolpath segments by their tool number for multi-tool G-code files
  5. User can drag a Z-clip slider that hides toolpath geometry above or below a chosen depth -- only the selected depth range is visible
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 32-01-PLAN.md — Filter state, toolbar UI, conditional rendering, color-by-tool, Z-clip

### Phase 33: Model-Toolpath Alignment
**Goal**: Model and toolpath overlay correctly in the viewport using FitParams, with point-match validation confirming the alignment is accurate
**Depends on**: Phase 32
**Requirements**: ALN-01, ALN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a Direct Carve workflow has computed FitParams (scale, offsetX, offsetY, depthMm), the model mesh transforms to machine space so it visually overlays the G-code toolpath at the correct position and scale
  2. System samples approximately 1% of cutting points from the toolpath and validates they lie on or near the mesh surface -- a pass/fail indicator shows whether model and toolpath correspond
  3. Alignment updates live when FitParams change (e.g., user adjusts stock dimensions in Direct Carve) -- the model repositions without requiring a manual refresh
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 33-01-PLAN.md — FitParams model matrix computation, DirectCarvePanel callback, wiring
- [ ] 33-02-PLAN.md — AlignmentValidator utility and toolbar pass/fail indicator

### Phase 34: Simulation Playback
**Goal**: User can play back the cutting simulation in the unified viewport with transport controls and visual progress feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Requirements**: SIM-01, SIM-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can play, pause, and scrub (seek via slider) through the G-code simulation in the viewport -- playback advances through toolpath segments at a controllable speed
  2. Completed path segments render in green, the currently executing segment renders in yellow, and a red dot marks the cutter position -- all three are visually distinct during playback
  3. Simulation controls are accessible from the viewport toolbar area -- the user does not need to switch to GCodePanel to start or control simulation
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 35: GCodePanel Rendering Elimination
**Goal**: GCodePanel no longer contains any 3D rendering infrastructure -- all viewport rendering is owned by ViewportPanel, and mouse interaction is unified across all visible layers
**Depends on**: Phase 31, Phase 32, Phase 33, Phase 34
**Requirements**: ELM-01, ELM-02, ELM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GCodePanel does not own or instantiate a Renderer, Camera, or Framebuffer -- all 3D rendering code has been removed from gcode_panel.cpp/h
  2. GCodePanel still provides its text-based G-code listing, file statistics, CNC sender controls, and file open/save functionality -- no non-rendering features are lost
  3. Mouse interaction (orbit, pan, zoom) in the viewport behaves identically whether the user is viewing model-only, toolpath-only, or both layers together -- no mode-dependent input differences
  4. The overall line count of gcode_panel.cpp decreases significantly from its pre-milestone size due to removed rendering code
**Plans**: TBD
